        <p>Coding it Forward is dedicated to inspiring and empowering people to use their technology skills for social good. We are excited to be collaborating with the Census Bureau and IRS to launch an elite public-sector summer fellowship program for college
          students interested in data science, technology, and data journalism.</p>


        <p>In this 10-week internship, we expect to send a cohort of data scientists, software engineers, product managers, designers, and data journalists to Washington, DC to work with these agencies. We're hoping to provide talented mentors with industry and government experience, exciting new projects you'll work directly with your mentor on, and potentially housing and funding.</p>

        <p>The Civic Digital Fellowship is the first of its kind on the federal level and is a great opportunity for students passionate about the intersection of technology and public service. This fellowship is targeted to students with both technical and non-technical
          skills. We are looking for:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Data scientists and software engineers</li>
          <li>
            Product managers</li>
          <li>
            Designers
          </li>
          <li>
            Data journalists</li>
        </ul>
