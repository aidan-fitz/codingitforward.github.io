<p>We're still working on making this fellowship a reality, but here's how we envision it: a cohort of students would spend this summer in DC working with government agencies, potentially including Census and the IRS, on new technology and data science projects. <strong>We're hoping to provide mentorship and funding as well.</strong></p>

<p>We'll be looking for everyone from data scientists and software engineers to designers, product managers, and digital communicators. We hope to have <strong>technical and non-technical roles available.</strong> If you're passionate about using your skills to serve the public, you might be interested in this opportunity!</p>

<p>Feel free to contact Neel Mehta (neelmehta [at] college [dot] harvard [dot] edu) with questions!</p>
