<h2>Civic Digital Fellowship</h2>

<p>
    <a href="http://codingitforward.com">Coding it Forward</a>, the <a href="http://harvard-open-data-project.github.io">Harvard Open Data Project</a>, and Harvard professor (and former Deputy CTO of the US) Nick Sinai are teaming up with the Census Bureau and the IRS to explore starting <strong>an elite public-sector summer technology and data fellowship for college students</strong>.
</p>

<p>We're still working on making this fellowship a reality, but here's how we envision it: a cohort of students would spend this summer in DC working with government agencies, potentially including Census and the IRS, on new technology and data science projects. <strong>We're hoping to provide mentorship and funding as well.</strong></p>

<p>We'll be looking for everyone from data scientists and software engineers to designers, product managers, and digital communicators. We hope to have <strong>technical and non-technical roles available.</strong> If you're passionate about using your skills to serve the public, you might be interested in this opportunity!</p>

<p>Fill out this form and you'll be the first to know if this opportunity becomes a reality.</p>

<p>Feel free to contact Neel Mehta (neelmehta [at] college [dot] harvard [dot] edu) with questions!</p>
