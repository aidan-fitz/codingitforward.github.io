<p>Coding it Forward is dedicated to inspiring and empowering people to use their technology skills for social good. We are excited to be collaborating with the Census Bureau and IRS to launch an elite public-sector summer fellowship program for college
  students interested in data science, technology, and data journalism. A cohort of selected students will spend the summer in Washington, D.C. working with federal agencies on new technology and data science projects.</p>

<p>The Civic Digital Fellowship is the first of its kind on the federal level and is a great opportunity for students passionate about the intersection of technology and public service. This fellowship is targeted to students with both technical and non-technical
  skills. We are looking for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Data scientists and software engineers</li>
  <li>
    Product managers</li>
  <li>
    Designers
  </li>
  <li>
    Data journalists</li>
</ul>
